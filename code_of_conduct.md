<span id="anchor"></span>A Code of Conduct for Open Source Projects
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Open Source has always been a foundation of the Internet, and with the
advent of social open source networks this is more true than ever. But
free, libre, and open source projects suffer from a startling lack of
diversity, with dramatically low representation by women, people of
color, and other marginalized populations.

Part of this problem lies with the very structure of some projects: the
use of insensitive language, thoughtless use of pronouns, assumptions of
gender, and even sexualized or culturally insensitive names.

Marginalized people also suffer some of the unintended consequences of
dogmatic insistence on meritocratic principles of governance. Studies
have shown that organizational cultures that value meritocracy [**often
result in greater
inequality**](http://asq.sagepub.com/content/55/4/543.short). People
with “merit” are often [**excused for their bad
behavior**](https://modelviewculture.com/pieces/the-dehumanizing-myth-of-the-meritocracy) in
public spaces based on the value of their technical contributions.
Meritocracy also naively assumes a level playing field, in which
everyone has access to the same resources, free time, and common life
experiences to draw upon. These factors and more make contributing to
open source a daunting prospect for many people, especially women and
other underrepresented people.

(For more critical analysis of meritocracy, refer to [**this
entry**](http://geekfeminism.wikia.com/wiki/Meritocracy) on the Geek
Feminism wiki.)

<span id="anchor"></span>A Small Step Forward
---------------------------------------------

An easy way to begin addressing this problem is to be overt in our
openness, welcoming all people to contribute, and pledging in return to
value them as human beings and to foster an atmosphere of kindness,
cooperation, and understanding.

The Contributor Covenant can be one way to express these values. Pledge
your respect and appreciation for contributors and participants in your
open source project by adding an explicit **CODE\_OF\_CONDUCT.md** to
your project repository.

(While more focused on events and conferences, this [**101 +
FAQ**](https://www.ashedryden.com/blog/codes-of-conduct-101-faq)addresses
many of the common questions and concerns around codes of conduct.)

<span id="anchor-1"></span>Using the Contributor Covenant
---------------------------------------------------------

We recommend that you add the Markdown or text version of the
Contributor Covenant to your source code repository at the root level.

Thanks to [**Simon
Vansintjan**](https://github.com/simonv3/covenant-generator) there is an
automated way to add Contributor Covenant to your project. Assuming that
you have [**Node.js**](https://nodejs.org/en/)installed, simply run the
following two commands from your project folder:

**npm install -g covgen**

**covgen &lt;tal@dav.network&gt;**

If you have npm 5.x installed you can run **npx covgen
&lt;tal@dav.network&gt;** instead of installing globally.

For subsequent projects, simply repeat the second command.

You may want to add language similar to this to introduce your code of
conduct:

Please note that this project is released with a Contributor Code of
Conduct. By participating in this project you agree to abide by its
terms.

You may also use the permalinks given above to reference from your
project home page.

**Important!** You must add a contact method to the placeholder in the
document so that people know how to report violations.

**The Contributor Covenant is released under the **[****Creative Commons
Attribution 4.0 International Public
License****](https://github.com/ContributorCovenant/contributor_covenant/blob/master/LICENSE.md)**,
which requires that attribution be included.**

<span id="anchor-1"></span>Enforcing the Contributor Covenant
-------------------------------------------------------------

Morality cannot be legislated, but behavior can be regulated.

> *Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.*

****Do not**** simply add the Contributor Covenant to your project and
assume that any problems with civility, harassment, or discrimination
will be solved. As a project maintainer you must be committed to
enforcing the code of conduct. A code of conduct without enforcement
sends a false signal that your project is welcoming and inclusive, and
can create a dangerous situation for marginalized people who
participate. Adding the Contributor Covenant to a project places
responsibility on the project team that must not be taken lightly.

Before adopting the Contributor Covenant take the time to discuss and
decide how to deal with problems as they emerge. Document the policy and
procedure for enforcement, and add it to your README or in another
visible, appropriate place. Consider if your project team has the
willingness and maturity to follow through on your enforcement
procedures.

Some resources useful for thinking about enforcement:
