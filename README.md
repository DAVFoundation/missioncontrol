Mission Control is a service running on the DAV network, and serving as a marketplace connecting DAV users looking to ship packages, with drone owners.

Mission Control demonstrates how a third party might build their own product, while integrating technologies provided by DAV, and provide a service to users connecting through a mobile app and independent drones connecting directly to Mission Control to offer their services.
