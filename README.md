Mission Control is a service running on the DAV network, and serving as a marketplace connecting DAV users, vehicles, and services.

Mission Control demonstrates how a third party might build their own product, while integrating technologies provided by DAV, and provide a service to users connecting through a mobile app and independent vehicles connecting directly to Mission Control to offer their services.
