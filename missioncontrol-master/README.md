Mission Control is a service running on the DAV network, and serving as a marketplace connecting DAV users, vehicles, and services.

### Contributing Code, Reporting Bugs and Suggesting Features

As an organization committed to extreme transparency, collaboration, and open-sourcing all of our work, we welcome participation from anyone willing to devote some time and energy to help shape DAV - whether you are a first time contributor, a veteran open-sourcerer, or just looking to suggest some ideas.
